# BloodLink
Academic project using MySQL
 The BloodLink portal
would provide critical analytics, such as live tracking of blood donations, real-time status
updates, a blood expiry tracker, and data on blood types in demand or surplus in different
locations. 

Project Objectives
BloodLink focusses on 5 key objectives:
Centralization of Data: Establish a centralized platform that facilitates seamless data sharing
among blood donation centers, blood banks and screening facilities, hospitals, and healthcare
providers.
Real-time Analytics: Implement real-time tracking of blood donations, inventory levels, and
blood type demands to enhance decision-making processes.
Enhanced Communication: Promote transparent communication between all stakeholders to
optimize inventory management.
Improved Efficiency: Streamline the blood donation process, minimizing delays and
inefficiencies in data collection and therefore distribution.
Data-Driven Re-distribution: Develop features that enable the identification, forecasting and
re-distribution of blood supplies to areas with specific needs, enhancing nationwide blood
distribution
